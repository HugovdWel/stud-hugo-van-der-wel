# Describe Sprint 1 focus #1

## Description of the intended result(s)

> Provide a description of the result here.

> If you are doing a research, try to come up with the research question or questions.

> It is likely that around half way the project you will pick up a wider variety of small tasks or bug fixes. In this situation you can collect these tasks in a single focus. 

### Cinemachine research
The aim is to do research into the cinemache in order to create some prototypes which the design team can then pick what they want from. 

Research question 1:
Is the Unity Cinemachine a good fit for our project?

Research question 2:
Do we need to write any code to add to the Unity Cinemachine camera's?

Research question 3:
How are transitions between camera's done in cinemachine?

## Project integration

> Explain the way your results are integrated in the complete game. Specify from which team(s) and people you need input from and which team(s) and people will likely use your results. Use the table below

| Result | Input From (team - person) | Output To (team - person) |
|---|---|---|
|Behaviour changes for the camera |Design input from the design team |Prototypes to design team |
|Behaviour changes for the camera |Feedback from the design team |Finished prototypes to programming team |
|Initial prototypes |Assignment description by Niels |Initial prototype for design team |

## Planned tasks

> Provide a idea of the tasks you think you need to do in order to obtain the intended result(s). Use the table below.

| When (indication) | Task | With Whom (from which team) |
