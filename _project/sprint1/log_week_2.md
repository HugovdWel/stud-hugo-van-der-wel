|2 |Added more cam's on Design's request |Design |More camera's. I also made the whole cam system a lot more standerdized so that any future cam requests could easily be added. |:smiley: | https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/27/commits/09be8b46e8e093daa2d341f41f414d038af45a7e|
|2 |Cinemachine pull request to feature branch improvement cycle |pro team |merged pull request |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/27 |
|2 |Added NPC movement base are and designed code |Some input from niels |I am still heavily conflicted about what way is the best for npc's to move. If we just use navmesh, they will hug the corners and that doesn't look good. I can't find anything that really helps here on google. I am considering trying to make the ground around all walls more costly to walk on somehow. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/41/commits/5232b1b61fc1486a87ff366859b1f254003179bc https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/41/commits/18aaa4fec862f374ec9caf79ea1f6d1fef00a725 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/41/commits/017379ff52068814e289671d83e76d4be310b5ee |

|3 |Integration with player |Danny en Niels |Some problems that weren't found in the original pull request. Turns out that the freelook camera needs to behave differently (again) |:scream: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/40 |
|2 |Pull request for cam to dev |alone with reviewers |Cam is in dev |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/29 |
|2 |Worked on Npc movement system. |Alone |I tried out a few different options, but am not convinced yet about which is the right one. I think having gameobject waypoints adds a lot for clarity, but at the same time it is more complex than vector3 waypoints. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/41/commits/18aaa4fec862f374ec9caf79ea1f6d1fef00a725 |

|2 |Camera improvements by Design request (yes, again, yes really) |:rage: |alone, input from niels and design |TBH the cam is nicer now, but i'm through with adjusing the camera every time design has a whim. We are going to follow the git rules closer from now. |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/48 |
|1 |Integrated cam with player model. |With Danny |If we find the need to change the playermodel regularly we're going to need a better way to do it, because this took too long. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/48 |
|4 |Tandarts |The good folks of Tandarts praktijk Element |Turns out one of the polish layers that had added in 2018 had fallen out. They grinded off a bit of my tooth and added a new layer. It feels kinda weired. |:teeth: |https://tandartspraktijkelement.nl/ |

|3 |Worked on improving NPC movement system |Alone |It's slow progress as I am struggeling strongly with the indication of what a pathnode does to someone looking at it in the editor.

|1 |Show your work prep and execution |Entire project group |Small demo about NPC movement |:smiley: |N/A |
|2 |sprint retrospective and planning |Programming team |We have enough tasks to fill one week roughtly, so we'll just have to see if integration difficulties spread that to two |:smiley: |N/A |
|3 |Still working on NPC movement |I have given up on the color changing (mostly). I tried to make it work by making a instanced material with a custom shader, but Unity realy doesn't like it when you try to edit a material instance in the editor. I have not found the best alternative way to do it yet, but I think I can give all trigger nodes the same color, no matter what they do |:scream: | |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/compare/develop...sub-task/feature-4-npc-advanced-movement |
