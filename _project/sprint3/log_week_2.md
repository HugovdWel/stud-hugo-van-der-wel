|1 |Nathan's pull req for charge jumping |Nathan |There was a lot to discuss and clarify about Nathan's pull req so I went to a seperate channel with him and we went over it. The main thing was that he used some libraries that uses sub-classes while our code styleguide says we shouldn't do that. When Nathan intherrited the library class he also implemented the sub-class, and so I tried to find a way to remove that internalization. It didn't work. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/147 |
|3 |More pull requests |Victor, Nick, Danny |There were problems with terrain where there were many invisible hitboxes and other similar problems. I thought the file structure was wrong as well, but it turned out that a decision had been made that I was not aware of. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/157 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/160 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/162 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/165 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/173 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/147 |

|6 |Samen met Nathan werken Npc Dialogue integration |Nathan |We wanted to work in the game scene first, but Maurice still needed it to do sound. That's why we made an empty scene and we started integrating there. Most of it was done on my laptop, but Nathan worked out more complicated problems related to the UI systems on his laptop. We ended up making prefabs to make it easy to load into the other scene. Not quite finished, but mostly. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/fb7bacb9489e5cde0950d8c697a8f30f368fb056 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/3be2e8c9653e9f45928c8d1ac9c6531794e827f7 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/f0f4478befaf15bd3e031eb054b01bdae50cf90e |

|4 |Integrating Asta and yarn into the game scene.|Danny, Nick |Nick joined me for a long time at the start. He told me what the ball of yarn had to do and where it went, and I made it happen. There were some unexpected problems because the npc needs a navmesh to walk on, and needs to get down from a roof without launching the ball through the ground. In the end it was only fully integrated right before the TT. |:stressed: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/a5c377e28b6bf1fece6b3a784fbf6e9ec601f408 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/dcebbe7bb5005a200d6d3f5e113aa9ae49e7bc4c https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/f5d70771fa3cb5941ea88dea83bef1b8b97a1f7c https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/a92dbd1e85e0f91080d5727a44ee53f1bd04ddb0 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/dcb8cf044e7cfba8329a43c0682d1d882881b94d https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/24d53e09afd7634d5498466fb0c40db5b805646d https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/9950feae3d755fe3f99f6798b5d676e416e76428 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/011e45f04b98ff038bd43c413e63dd5f9c881ad4 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/12dbe8c1aad3675cd7b32825fa640843bdf1fd69 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/24185508641601d94c69a0b67ee49ad0daca8c82 |
