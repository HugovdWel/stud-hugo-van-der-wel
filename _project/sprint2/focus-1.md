# Describe Sprint 2 focus #1

## Description of the intended result(s)

> Provide a description of the result here.

> If you are doing a research, try to come up with the research question or questions.

> It is likely that around half way the project you will pick up a wider variety of small tasks or bug fixes. In this situation you can collect these tasks in a single focus. 

Desired result: A camera that shows an area through an aerial flight.

Research eagle flight camera.


Main question:
What is the best way for this project to implement the eagle flight mechanic?

Sub-questions:

Do any plugins provide functionality for the eagle flight mechanic?
Is it hard to make the mechanic ourselves with a default camera?
