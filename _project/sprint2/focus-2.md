# Describe Sprint 2 focus #2

## Description of the intended result(s)

> Provide a description of the result here.

> If you are doing a research, try to come up with the research question or questions.

> It is likely that around half way the project you will pick up a wider variety of small tasks or bug fixes. In this situation you can collect these tasks in a single focus. 

Research NPC movement
Desired result: A system that allows NPC's to move from waypoint to waypoint.

Main question:
What is the best way to implement the movement of NPC's in this project?

Sub questions:
Are there any plugins that implement character movement?

Does Unity provide a package for character movement?

How hard is it to implement character movement ourselves?
