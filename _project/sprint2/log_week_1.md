|2.5 |Doc review with Daniël |I need to make sure I have my docuements ready on time this sprint. My first research was OK but not great. My method of logging was reviewed as good, so i'm going to keep this up. |:smiley: |N/A |
|3 |NPC movement | | I canged my approach to the issue today. The way I want to visualize the pathing is simply not realistically possible in Unity. I tried to make the color changes work in a number of different ways, but the problem they all run into is that the editor does not support all scripts. You can not modify a instance of a color in the editor without creating a memory leak. This is due to the way Unity handles materials the renderer in the scene view. If you try to instance the color outside of a running game the best it can do is create a duplicate material, which then doesn't get removed. I tried to make a custom shader, shared materials materialproperties block, nothing works. I'm now just switching to picking the most impactful node property to determine the color. | :scream:ø | https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/2393645c8c70e89a5b255ad472973bc0fe4c16eb https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/8efe70031690aa28117be5c88d6c86363f0ee01d |

|3 |Finished advanced NPC movement |Alone |The code is a lot cleaner and more understandable now. I compacted a number of one line functions into compact statements. This may make it more complicated to understand, but it also increases the overview |:smiley: |N/A |

|1 |Show your work |class |I think nobody really showed interesting things. I'm not going to flame everyone, but it was a boring hour |:smiley: |N/A |
|1 |Left for home early cause sick |Nobody |Felt bad all day but went to school anyway cause I wasn't coughing or anything. Then, at like 3 I started feeling really bad really quick. I was so cold I had to wear a coat inside all zipped up. I left at half past 3 |:sick: |N/A |
|1 |Review pull requests |Pro team |Niels had saving issues, I reviewed and called the problem. It was a initialization issue where 2 tasks where in start functions but one needed to run before the other. I prototyped it and was right, so Niels fixed it |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/76 |
|2 |Made cam tweaks |Design team |I adjusted the camera's positioning and behavior to the new cat model and changes. I also cleaned up some unused cam features. Afterwards I talked with design to see if they wanted any more changes, and they wanted the cam to be less sensitive. This is a problem because it's dependant on the users mouse sensitivity, but i turned the general sensitivity down. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/75 |
