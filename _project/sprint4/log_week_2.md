|2 |Stuck in integration hell reviewing pull requests |Programming |Not much to remark about any specific pull request, except that the names of scripts and functions are quickly becoming more funny as the project is ending. If I had know about this before, I would have tried harder to name the "FollowParrentController" script "FollowDaddy". At the time it got veto'd by Niels. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/267 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/274 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/279 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/284 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/286 |
|2 |Finishing removing "E to interact" while in a memory |Alone |The easiest way to fix this ended up being seperating the memories from the UI controller, and adding the memory on the object it was linked to. This also happened to solve some other related bugs such as that loading the game made the UI controller show you the wrong memory. I did kind of work on the wrong branch, so I had to do a bunch of git magic to not lose a lot of complicated changes. A lot of the commits below are reverts and reverts of reverts. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/68a66e1067643c7b3eb057c5bbf425e04965e52f  https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/4836138406cb53adb2a1bf42e66ac854baf3c607 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/c7b10f5e34b3b75ef370e2e92287eaf72c61caaf https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/66803495093c7c1c2490a2c2525d63001fdec399  https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/a2aeba51be03ffb22b508f5e2043e09cd1fa948f https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/90d9cdfbb8cd4ce43d770eb71984d7ef5c083d14 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/e04ab5f0f0c3c8ae9d16f838542f122a6af92cb1 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/3505c4fab13e1ff8ee974b6771df8e01f3b6b6db https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/e5ff9de6411c44739532030048fc340b8ccf6a84 | 
|3 |Unified the different freeze player methods |Alone |There were 3 to 5 different pieces of code that each froze the player movement, controlls, or view angle in their own way. I went about creating a central system that did all the freezing and releasing. I tested out a few solutions, but quickly decided to to go with a static class that calls a event that the player listens to. This is kind of expensive, but since the freeze player method is not called continually that does not matter. The advantage is that it requires absolutely no coupling within a scene, and works instantly within any class that wants to freeze any control. (addendum: I later found out that the UI controller unfreezes the movement lock every single update frame, but the event call is not very expensive because there is only 1 listener.)|:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/95c1079fee98cc71ea008cc95fab39efb4ad01fa https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/dd1baa5cc6306e24de7d6580914890c02aae9b2b https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/b852326cb1b2d275c9199447007436c102a695d6 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/bd6e03cc5ffe3a75a3c1ebc09a4b02e65929b3a5 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/b759f299a02c7b23db5a66488449488f6e296cf4 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/22a6dbe9e3759e98ba762ecfecc718262f95226a https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/2a6998de9c51aa1f7ff9ab910785713bd45abbe3 |
