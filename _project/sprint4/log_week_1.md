|3 |Fixing game scene problems |Niels, Danny |For the terrible thursday we had to make the Asha dialogue into a bunch of one line dialogues that played as she walked through the forest. Today, we had to undo all of that because design didn't like it. There was also a lot of buginess with the yarn that did not follow the rules of physics, and that was also my problem to fix. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/be1ee83c22b22fcb9fc21d47dad15333da60e11b  https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/2b21caa09acd7a27dbb5a9932a2a5faf072d5f78 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/1dd79f0719ed6a5a94e0daf7d302d418c4856b85 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/ea78d161a46f879c83d2ba2b2838c0e7fac91583 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/e3961808320de2ff74b521682480efc6f579e3f5 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/66e6220d386a2e02211960160067952cce39b476 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/c5edb92ddb4d953cc78c5bf5be02f51a9e90050c https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/619e14cd132d356e978a863a07e5e820749a495a https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/c4a06d07b6af9ab70b686059cf9f9d1e91143ba1 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/a212d28f001daeda02b89913a4097a8796c6d250 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/df65241665eabc408efa27288530f7e553f22d52 |

|4 |Cam fix | |There was a problem where if you died in a camera zone, the camera would stay on. I tried a few ways of fixing it. Eventually I found that I had to change the camera state machine to fix the problem. It took a while to refresh myself on how that worked, but I got it working.  |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/a208c9d0fc39eaf2246ff6e9f6cc2193f829bbcc |

|5 |Added Asha inside her house, and then added it to the main scene |India, Luc |Since I could not work in the game scene to make this, I just made it seperately and turned it into a prefab which could quickly be integrated into the game scene. Due to some merge conflicts it was not as easy as expected, but eventually it worked. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/592f40dace3ba5d69a45d14f3ff4e1ddac014b18 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/48481843210085be9aa46ed0e58224abd73f639a https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/698407f4af9202f57d874ec1b7e51ee14d5536a5 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/3feea11b1133c9083966750f52bd9cc2d2e46151 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/dd2c8f16d0ce65249ccc7e2d572323b570274d48  |
|2 |Fixed asha load bug where she would walk back to the start upon loading |Niels |We edited the save load system to fix this bug. Diagnosing the problem was very problematic, but the fix was quite simple. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/5022fbc344632643ff6cb62758518605da8a1303 |

|1 |Fixed npc to allow them to not have a route |Alone |It was a oversight that I assumed that any npc that had a movement script would be moving. So I added the ability for npc's to just stand and wait for a movement order. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/57f82f4065d921c09f405b5250d11f524878db70 |
|2 |Started fixing the "e to interact" popping up on memories again |Luka, Nathan |The "E to interact" had been removed from memories when the feature was made, but somehow it started showing up again. Nathan was busy so luka and me looked into the bug, which turned out to be quite complicated. Later Nathan had time and joined us, and the start of a solution was found. |:smiley: |https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/commit/0fcf4fe11c7cc5328a3293ee4684a175de9d0bcd https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/253 https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-a/A-Passing-Friend/pull/257 |
